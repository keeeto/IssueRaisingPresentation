### Issue etiquette

* Our template is very good - try to follow it
* Clearly state the problem
* Clearly lay out how to reproduce any problems
* Consider giving some background
* Justify the priority it is given
* Remember that anyone in the team could be reading this Issue, so the content and tone may inform people other than those taking part, now or later.
